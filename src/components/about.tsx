            <h3> About Me </h3>
            <p>Hey!!. My name is Adonis, I graduated from WethinkCode and the University of Johannesburg, and I will finish my honors degree at the end of 2023. I am a person who handles issues clearly and analytically. I work hard and I really think that if something can be learned, nothing can stop me from learning it.</p>
            <p>I started working as a volunteer at a shelter named "Kids Heaven" during my senior year of high school, where I taught computer literacy to the children who were interested. I really appreciated the work since it allowed me to teach someone else and reinforce the ideas by having toÂ think about them in new ways as I tried to make the students understand. I have developed my communication and interpersonal abilities by taking part in these numerous elements. Additionally, I've been able to hone my problem-solving abilities when the normal and typical way of doing things is no longer effective.</p>
            <p>I think I'm a perfect fit for the SOVTECH graduate program since I uphold the principles of the organization. I enjoy technology, I am daring, I am a team player, and I am continuously learning and adapting.</p>
